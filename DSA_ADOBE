For Arrays:
When we need to reduce the size of array on a going steps then we move to use, stack kind a thing.
Frequency mostly question done by using HashMap <When 2 and 3 given so first tend to remove on basis of 3 not on 2 if they are getting divided.
*** LITTLE BIT Math,  if we want minimum ways to remove 10 and we are allowed to use 3 and 2 so min ways is 6 and 4  --> this can easily be done by cnt+=t/3 and then use cnt+=1;


**bits** logic --> get the ith bit:- (num>>(i-1))&1;
--->set the ith bit:- (num|(1<<(i-1);
--->Clear the ith bit:- (num - (1<<(i-1)));
--->Remove the last bit: num & num-1;   ((And as well as finding power of 2)) becuase num&num-1 will give 0;
--->Whenever things like counting set BITS, finding power of 2 is directly related with N&N-1
        //We have following steps:
        //AND || OR || XOR || ADD || Subtract || N-1
        //Remember when case with related to 2 then definitely use these bit manipulation

---->Setting rightmost bit: n|(n+1);
---->rightmost = (xr&(xr-1))^xr;  || 110 & 101->100^110 -->10 i.e righmost bit no.

--->>When we need to skip, but at the same time <string size changes> then dp use--> fails
     Stack use fails deletion of characters in string itself due to given condition--> here we can carry boolean variable which can tell us whether we encountered or not.

    {
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
        {
            prime[i] = i;

            if(prime[i]==i)
            {
                for(int j=i*i;j<=n;j+=i)   //Thsi is for smallest prime factor;
                {
                    if(prime[j]==j)
                    {
                        prime[j]=i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }



---->For Questions such as we have the getting many and many no of vairalbe dp ;
//then it must be think it of tabulation where we can reduce the no. of dimensions.

//Whereever we need the backward things for current level kind a thing,  we can use dp(mostly single dp array) and other vairable which need to be adjusted as here height.



** ---> When we are using sliding window remember when we reduce from start and we want count from front end for the total upto a certain condition, just go with start++ and in end just add.
