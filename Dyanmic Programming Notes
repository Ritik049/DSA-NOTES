## IDEA of DP is --> Memoisation and tabulation and space optimisation
##top down-->genarlly memoisation and bottom up -->generally tabulation

//Fix steps
//First form the problem in terms of index 
//Then write base case 
//Then write all possible cases
//Then just memoise and tabulize


## For counting no. of ways we just return 1 in base case especially top down approach. 


## For absolute difference you need to not just put it forth directly like arr[n] - helper(n-1) this is wrong way as helper[n-1] give answer not the array element.

## Whenever we are going backwards like 2 steps, or k steps befor going first check n>=i


## use some your practical brain, as least amount in money is 0 not negative.

## FOR PICK YOU NEED TO GO TO I-2 type so first do pick = nums[i] and if i>1 then only do Pick+=dp[i-2]

## for circuar thing tend to use the first INclude and last exclude separately, and first exclude and last include separately,

## IT is not necessary that for maximum we need a max[] kind a variable we just think it of as we are going to top down approach so we can not use maximum varialbe and return
//We just try all possible values, and find maximum for current index.

## Whenever we use DP we not take sum||maximum along with us, and remember dp one formula for that correct index we are going to store all answer.
## we just find the possibilities with putting that current elemnet thne find maximum. <IN DP>
##IN recursion summation can haappen so (mostly from i=0 ---> i==n )



*** This is normal Recursion template **   <<HERE SUMMATION APPROACH USED>>
 public int helperRecursion(int[][]points,int index,int prev,int sum)
    {
        //BASE CASE
        if(index==points.length) return sum;
        
        //Possibilities
        int maximum = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++)
        {
            if(i!=prev)
            {
                maximum = Math.max(maximum,helperRecursion(points,index+1,i,sum+points[index][i]));
            }
        }
        
        return maximum;
    }

    }

<<SEE TABULATION APPRoach also as specifically ninja here we take one index extra due to prevINdex!=currIndex  (for starting) and IN DP it is fix that in at any point of dp Array it is the answer. ie. dp[n-1][3]
//For maximum we can use dp itself.

** FUNDA of DP ARRAY at any given index whole answer get stored.


##AS it may happen there is element 0th case;
** target==0 &&  arr[0]==0 return 2; target ==0 || arr[0]==target return 1;

## for coins kind a problem where we need to divide the array element and do the count so tend to stop at the oth index and tend to find out the no. of coins or else return maximum;

## tend to go with index<0 cases as here you need not to handle more cases;
## As if gonna with count ways and using same index multiple time no problem to return 1;
## But if there is case where we need to return the value || maximum kind thing like knapSack problem, thaen, we need to use W/wt[0] *v[0];

## Always think in terms of dp that current index is our answer this will help you to , set the base case;
## for rod cutting it is also i/1*price[0]


## for LCS try to print from backwards so you need to just use two pointers only.

## longest common substring, --> here we accumulate and add only when we have same character and here not take we just take 0 and to store answer we use answer variable to store maximuml

## Whenever we not want answer from notPick but answer from pick otherwise it should be zero but we want notPick stps  take place then we use answer variable to store the answer;

## for longest palindromic subsequence we can use just longest common subsequeence just do one thing jsut reverst the string

## for making string palindrome,  we need to just find LCs then do minus;


@#Whenver question is like make a stirng equal to another string by adding || removing tend to use LCS becasue of minimum;

## For shortest common supersequence problem here we put characters same as here while finding our LCS then add rest of characters.

## for loop is used only when we need to find the subsequence of stirng inside that string itself not for comparing  it is for generating.

## When we are involving with two string and finding some commanality and equal we always take two index and slove by these two like distinct subsequences == t

## Whenever question like minimum maximum operations to make string 1 to string 2 so always think of dp




//**************** STOCKS DP **************************
** //At any given index we have two possibilities.
//We start from first
        //Eitehr move ahead, or not buy  or buy/sell at given index.
        //For moving ahead we have no value associated with it.
        //As think buy sell operation as doing sum where we assigning sign +ve and -ve to getting total profit.
        //First write answer expression , then relate with question expression how you get answer then find pattern in it.
        //Then think recursive approach.

** think in normal maximum and just play with the indexes;
## we can play with the indexes as well;like for index>=n in dp , we can do fpr dp[n+1] or dp[n+2] if reuqeired
