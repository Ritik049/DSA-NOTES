*Sorting the array: (STACK) → For sorting purpose always use stack Itself, and just put a single element out and just delegate work to recursion and in last insert that element
//TC = O(N2), SC = O(N)


**Reversing the array: (STACK) —> for reversiong purpose always use stack itself, just delegate work to recursion,and just insert the top most element to its correct position.


**Generating All String (HAVING CONDITION)---> Especially with last condition(prev Character, so put that character into temp string and send it as previous for next iteration.
//TC = O(2^N) SC = O(N)
